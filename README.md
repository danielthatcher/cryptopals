# Cryptopals
These are solutions to the [cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) written using Go. They were written while I was still learning go, and as such some of the code is not particularly well written but hopefully they are still informative. The last four challenges of set 7 are missing as the hash-based challenges help my interest a little less than the encryption-based ones.
